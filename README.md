Wow! is a tiny, extremely simple Luau-based static site generator.

- Build your pages in Luau with [Fusion](https://github.com/dphfox/Fusion)-style syntax
- Define reusable components as Luau functions
- Incredibly simple to generate and deploy!

Almost everything in Wow! is designed as a bag of small utility functions. It's
easy to customise what parts of Wow! you use, and everything remains interoperable thanks to the use of common Luau types. Not to mention, you get
wow-tastic strict Luau types for free ðŸŒ
